# Steps for creating a Breeze Vue App

Here we are going to create a new [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) application, using Breeze to handle the data management.

We will assume that you've already got the server side created, following the outline described in the [STEPS](STEPS.md) document.

For the client, we will start with an empty directory and build an application that
talks to the server, using Breeze to query and update data.

Along the way we will:

- Create a Vue application using the CLI
- Create TypeScript entity classes from the server metadata
- Create a Vue component to read and update entities

# Coming soon

In the meantime, you can look at the [NorthwinVue demo app](https://github.com/Breeze/northwind-core-ng-demo/tree/master/NorthwindCore/NorthwindVue).
